## Project Description
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America,
 and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages 
and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

In this project, we had been being train a convolutional neural network to
 classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, we had been being the network 
and test its performance.

## Project Tasks

1. American Sign Language (ASL)
2. Visualize the training data
3. Examine the dataset
4. One-hot encode the data
5. Define the model
6. Compile the model
7. Train the model
8. Test the model
9. Visualize mistakes
