## ASL-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures. In this project, you will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, you will train the network and test its performance.
 
in this project, we will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, we will train the network and test its performance.

In the code cell below, we load the training and test data.

x_train and x_test are arrays of image data with shape (num_samples, 3, 50, 50), corresponding to the training and test datasets, respectively.
y_train and y_test are arrays of category labels with shape (num_samples,), corresponding to the training and test datasets, respectively.
